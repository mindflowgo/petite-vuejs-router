# Petite-VueJS Router

Petite-VueJS is positioned as a very simple tool to allow plugging in vue-compatible code into some project.

It's a very small library (6k) that works directly on the DOM, yet it allows all the familiar elements of working with Vue-JS.

However, because of it's scope, it's intentionally not made to have routing, etc.

Frameworks like React and VueJS 3 are awesome, but because they do not work on the DOM directly and you have to jump through their gatekeeping DOM-manipulation tools (Reactive/useState/...).

If you want to work around other vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript elements, then it becomes much more challenging... so you are forced into using libraries that have been adapter for the respective framework.

This was where the AureliaJS framework really shone because it worked on the DOM directly, was pretty straightforward, but unfortunately never developed mass-following. Petite-Vue, and 
other solutions like Alpine seem to build on that vision, so I thought I'd add in an example 
of how to do routing and global store within it.

My basic vision: a framework that works directly on the DOM, hence allowing all the regular 
javascript tools, thus it keeps out of the way, yet provides all the power of itself when 
needed. In memory of AureliaJS, I share this!

Feedback welcome here.
